  A distributed church is a group of people who are choosing to focus
  their lives on Jesus in such a way that their very existence,
  activities, and conversations proclaim the good news of God.
  Connected to a network of churches and committed to one another, a
  distributed church is a spiritual family whose identity and
  arrangement is centered on who God is, what He has done, and what He
  calls the church to be and do in this world.

  Said shorter, a distributed church is a group of people who are
  focusing their lives on Jesus, seeking to more intentionally relate
  to one another in Life-giving ways (community), help one another
  become established in the teaching and character of Jesus
  (discipleship), and together live out the mission of Jesus (service
  and evangelism).

  What is the typical size? It varies: 10-15; 20-50; 70; even 2-3 can

  One thing you see from this definition is that living as the church
  is not limited to gathering in particular types of buildings for a
  particular kind of experience. It also isn't about adding a bunch of
  different events to our lives. It is about being a particular kind
  of people intentionally linking together around a particular way of
  life. In fact, the early followers of Jesus were said to follow
  "The Way."

  Living as the church is about being a people, centered on Jesus as
  the head and cornerstone, maturing together as a living, breathing
  proclamation of the gospel, to serve and include those not yet
  included, in our neighborhoods, and cities, and nations. (Exodus
  6:7; Jeremiah 30:22; Leviticus 26:12; Matthew 5:14-16; Luke 10:2;
  Colossians 1:15-20; Ephesians 2:11-22; 1 Peter 2:1-9; Revelation 21)

%p
  God's plan to bring His kingdom to earth has not changed and the
  heart of that plan is communities of disciples, transformed by
  Jesus, serving others.
