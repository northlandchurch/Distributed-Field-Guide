          A Distributed Church is most simply understood as a group of
          people following Jesus together and living out the mission
          of Jesus in their everyday lives. When people do this
          together they form the church right in the context of where
          they are now.

      %p
        At the heart of it, a Distributed Church is about love. It's
        about God's love for you, and his design for you to love
        others. God has strategically placed you in the context where
        you are right now: the web of relationships you already have;
        the neighborhood where you already live; the place where you
        already work. A Distributed Church is a way to bring the
        church, and thus the love of God, to those people.
      %p
        A Distributed Church is also about the way God has uniquely
        created you - with specific gifts for specific purposes - to
        help others experience His love. Your abilities, the way you
        think, even the things you struggle with, all point toward
        God's design and deliberate plan. You have been designed for
        a mission unlike any other in this world. It's a mission that
        you can't accomplish without God's power, or without other
        Christians alongside you.
      %p
        Are you interested in learning more? We would love to help
        you. Together we can form the church outside the walls of a
        building and bring God's love to the world.
