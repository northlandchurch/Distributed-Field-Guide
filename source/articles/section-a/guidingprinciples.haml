  %li
    A church that centers on God and forms around others rather than insisting that “our church” is
    the center of the universe. This is a “Copernican Revolution” of the church.
  %li
    Intentional distribution of the church with a goal of ultimate connection though the kind of
    relationship that reflects God’s image.
  %li
    A network of churches sharing resources with one another, linking differences and bridging
    distances for the benefit of all.
  %li
    A way for the church at large to benefit from our differences, being perfected by those enough
    like us to be intimate yet different enough to be necessary.
  %li
    A comprehensive model in which spiritual maturity will continue to develop through generations
    of relationships.
  %li
    Congregation members who spend much of their Christian lives connected to those who are
    outside the local congregation.
  %li
    Putting the resources of the church as close to people as possible, offering meeting points and
    access to resources, in order to assist Christians in empowering others.
  %li
    Connecting to outsiders ("them") and serving them where they are ("there"), rather than getting
    them to join us.
  %li
    Arranging the church around the relationships of the congregation and partner ministries, rather
    than mainly in and around a physical church building.
  %li
    Connecting with neighboring (non-Northland) Christians for support and encouragement to
    better serve their communities.
  %li
    Reorienting ministry efforts from inside to outside, from solitary to partnered, to an arrangement
    that constantly reminds us of God.
