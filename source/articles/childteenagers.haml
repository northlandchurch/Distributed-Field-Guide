  It is a daunting discovery when we realize that, as the Church, we are the ones responsible for
  supporting parents in discipling the next generation in our distributed churches as well as providing
  one another with the support, accountability, and grace we need as the spiritual leaders of our
  children.

%p
  How can a distributed church provide this for families?

  Jesus said, ‘Let the little children come to Me, and
  do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven
  belongs to such as these.’” (Matthew 19:14)
%p
  “If anyone causes one of these little ones—those
  who believe in Me—to stumble, it would be better
  for them to have a large millstone hung around
  their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the
  sea.” (Matthew 18:6)

  “Love the LORD your God with all your heart and
  with all your soul and with all your strength. These
  commandments that I give you today are to be on
  your hearts. Impress them on your children. Talk
  about them when you sit at home and when you
  walk along the road, when you lie down and when
  you get up. Tie them as symbols on your hands
  and bind them on your foreheads. Write them on
  the doorframes of your houses and on your gates.”
  (Deuteronomy 6:5-9)

  “Join together in following my example, brothers
  and sisters, and just as you have us as a model,
  keep your eyes on those who live as we
  do.” (Philippians 3:17)
%p
  “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and
  with all your soul and with all your strength and
  with all your mind; and, love your neighbor as
  yourself.” (Luke 10:27)

    For parents:
    %br
    Encourage parents to embrace the new mindset of
    being a disciple and making disciples. Their sons
    and daughters learn how to respond in life by
    watching how their parents respond in
    relationships, in conflict, in success, in failure, in
    disappointment, and in those moments when we
    give in to temptation.
  %p
    Discipling our sons and daughters is not as simple
    as developing godly habits such as praying,
    attending church, or doing acts of service. It is a
    daily walk where we are modeling the attitude of
    Christ and the daily navigation of His greatest
    commandments. (Luke 10:27)

  Getting Started

%p
  Your distributed church is unique, so in your quest to provide a weekly place for the next
  generation to learn Bible stories and how to apply them, it may take time to find the best fit. Check
  out the options below, or design your own plan. With prayerful consideration and some trial and
  error, you can develop a plan that fulfills our responsibilities to the next generation and our calling
  as disciples making disciples together.

%p
  Choosing Curriculum: When selecting curriculum for adults, teens, or children, check to see
  whether the curriculum seems to be more God-centered or man-centered. For example, if the
  overview or table of contents focuses on who God is, what He has done, and how we can serve
  and love Him according to His Word, that will serve your church better than one that focuses on
  the human heroes of the faith and how to be more like them.

%p
  More about teenagers: Know your teens… the teenage years are not one-size fits all! Take the time
  to ensure that each teenager in your gathering has the opportunity to grow, learn, and to be lead.
  Some teenagers learn best by teaching the younger children. Some need time with peers or time
  alone to discover ways to apply God’s Word to their lives. Be flexible in adapting any of the options
  above.
