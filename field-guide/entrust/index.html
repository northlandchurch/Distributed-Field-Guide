        Section B&#58; Distributing the Church
      </h4>
      <h1>Entrust</h1>
      <p>
        In his letter to the churches in Colossae, Paul declares that Christ “is before all things, and in Him
        all things hold together. He is also head of the body, the church.” Jesus Himself took ownership of
        “His Church” when he proclaimed to Peter “I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock
        I will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.” We are Christ’s Church. He
        is the head, He is our identity, and He is the one we serve.
      </p>
      <p>
        But there is also a pervasive expectation throughout the scriptures that everyday people would be
        the ones to carry Christ’s work forward. The church we read about in the Bible was not a
        movement of an elite class of highly educated people; the church of the Bible was a movement of
        regular people transformed by the presence of Jesus. In fact, in an exchange between the elite
        religious class and the disciples in Acts 4, the religious elite comment on the contrast between the
        disciples’ works and their ordinariness.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled,
        ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with
        Jesus.” (Acts 4:13)
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        It is Christ’s church, fueled by the Holy Spirit, and He has chosen to bestow upon us all the
        “priesthood of all believers” as declared by Peter:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession,
        that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful
        light.” (1 Peter 2:9)
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The building of the Church has been entrusted to us by Jesus and we are invited to engage the
        work for the progress of the Gospel instead of deferring to professionals and institutions. We must
        exhort and encourage every follower of Jesus to use their gifts and embrace the ministry and
        mission given to them by God. And, we must identify those among us that show particular skill in
        leading, and train them up to carry the mission forward. Engaging the mission of God can happen
        by leading local groups of people or focusing on expansion of the movement of Christ around the
        world.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Leader
      </h2>
      <p>
        Leadership of a distributed church is more about guiding a community to live according to their
        identity as Jesus followers (I Am = Us For Them There), than it is about executing a "to do" list. As
        Jesus defined leading as serving. Leaders must demonstrate a consistent effort to establish the
        group in the faith that unites them, help them become a spiritual family, and exhort them to love
        and good deeds. Leading also involves connecting the distributed church to the wider network and
        movement of what God is doing, and raising up leaders to expand the movement through the
        establishment of new churches.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Plurality of Leadership
      </h2>
      <p>
        Distributed Churches are led by a team. Collective leadership lightens the workload for each
        person, making the church life-giving and sustainable, but it also provides a variety of gifting,
        making the church more effective in its mission. This posture requires more patience, discussion,
        and dependence on prayer and Scripture and can at times be slow and frustrating. Not everyone is
        equal in their knowledge of the Bible, their gifting from God, and even their commitment, so
        deference to the strengths and perspectives of others is key.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to a plurality of leadership, the churches are designed to encourage every member
        participation in the life of the church, and the gatherings of the church. As Paul repeatedly reminds
        the early churches, there are a variety of gifts necessary for the church to function together as an
        extended family. This valuing of the other and encouraging contribution from all is key to the
        experience of the smaller church community and is a large part of how the community itself is a
        proclamation of the Gospel. (Romans 12:3-8)
      </p>
      <h2>
        Roles and Responsibilities
      </h2>
      <p>
        The primary image the Bible uses to help us understand the role of church leader is that of
        shepherd. Jesus, Paul, and Peter regularly turned to shepherding metaphors in their instructions to
        the leaders of churches and in the first-century, agrarian culture this would have invoked imagery of
        commitment, courage, skill, hard work, along with tenderness, sacrifice, faithfulness, and love.
        Using the metaphor of shepherd as a backdrop, we can outline the role church leaders play within
        the church community:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Model the life</strong>
        (1 Timothy 4:1-16; 2 Timothy 2:3-6)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Live a life oriented around Jesus.</li>
        <li>Care for practical needs of the church.</li>
        <li>Serve people outside your church.</li>
        <li>Seek to include those not yet included.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Establish the church</strong>
        (Titus 1:5; 2:15; Timothy 3:14-16; 1 Thessalonians 2:1-3:10)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Take responsibility for the spiritual formation of people.</li>
        <li>Dedicate time to prayer, scripture, and giving and receiving spiritual direction.</li>
        <li>Lead between gatherings, not just in the time of gathering, to develop the community into an extended family.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Teach Scripture; Guard the teaching</strong>
        (2 Timothy. 4:1-4; 2:22-26; 1 Timothy 4:1-16)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Teaching in a distributed church is via dialogue, not lecture.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify gifts and abilities of the church; in particular devote time to developing leaders</strong>
        (Romans 12:3-8; Acts 20:17-38; 2 Timothy 2:2; 1 Timothy 3:1-7; 5:17-25; Titus 1:2-9)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Build a team to share responsibility for the functioning of the group.</li>
        <li>Call out leaders.</li>
        <li>Commission new churches in response to opportunities the Holy Spirit presents.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Respond to opportunities to take the Gospel to new areas and establish new churches</strong>
        (Acts 13:1-14:26; 15:36-16:5; Philippians 1:3-7; 2:19-24; 1 Thessalonians 1:1-3:13; 1 Tim. 3:14-16; Titus 1:5)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Local opportunities</li>
        <li>International opportunities</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In summary: Live the life. Shepherd the family. Establish people in the foundational principles of the
        faith by teaching the Word. Guard that teaching from false teachers. Exhort and admonish the
        saints in sound doctrine. Call out the God given gifts in the church. Raise up new leaders to
        establish new churches. Spur the church on to love and good deeds in such a way that the sick
        are visited, the poor are cared for, the widows and orphans find community, the neighborhood and
        city are blessed, and the Gospel is proclaimed.
      </p>
      <p>Easy, right?</p>
      <h2>
        Training
      </h2>
      <p>The key philosophy of training is this: All training is IN ministry, not FOR ministry.</p>
      <p>
        The reasoning behind this philosophy brings us back to the commission Jesus gave us in Matthew
        28. “As you are going…” Jesus’s methodology was to develop people along the way; His
        exhortation to us follows this same approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        The brilliance of this approach is the understanding that community and context are as important
        to training as content. Paul correctly exhorts us to be transformed by the renewing of our minds,
        but this doesn’t simply equate to knowing a set of intellectual precepts. If that were the case, then
        a lecture once a week would work (and transformation would be much more prevalent today)! The
        kind of transformation and renewal Paul is talking about is orienting our minds toward wisdom as
        we conform our lives around the Truth. The training for this comes in the context of life situations,
        as we learn from those further along, and develop right responses and habits and ultimately
        character.
      </p>
      <p>
        I n fact, most of the qualifications and discussions of leadership in Scripture have to do with
        character. It is clear that who you are becoming, and the gifts that God has given you, are more
        important than your ability to wax eloquently on obscure doctrinal issues, or whether or not you
        can organize a Sunday morning worship service.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostles left us a great deposit of faith that can be transferred from person to person, and
        community to community. The foundation is the Gospel. What follows is a lifelong pursuit of
        mastering the Scriptures that the Apostles assumed would be normative for every follower of
        Jesus. In fact, the writer of Hebrews has some stern words to the churches that had ceased this
        pursuit (Hebrews 5:12-14). So, we train each other IN ministry, along the way, as we together
        follow Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
        This also brings us back to the parallel between church and discipleship. Because they are so
        closely linked, the core of what you need to pursue is how to lead people toward a life of serving
        Jesus and serving others in the name of Jesus. What you don’t need to know is how to run an
        institution.
      </p>
      <p>
        By beginning to form your existing relationships into a distributed church, a church outside the
        walls of a building, you’ll be joining illiterate goat farmers in India that are leading churches. You’ll
        join factory workers in China that are leading churches. And in the United States you’ll join
        teachers, landscapers, lawyers, construction workers, and people from all walks of life leading
        churches. In fact, around the world only a small percentage of the church is led by professional
        clergy.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, do you need training before you start? You need the Gospel and you need the Holy Spirit.
        Do you need training along the way? Yes, and you’ll spend your whole life pursuing it.
        Will you do any of this alone? No. You’ll be connect through relationship to people in your
        distributed church and other leaders in the network of churches.
      </p>
      <p>
        What about your failures and insecurities? Remember that God only uses broken vessels and
        wounded healers. There has only ever been one sinless person and He is the one inviting you to
        join Him in this work.

        the advanced training you’ll need if you find God calling you to lead a cluster or a whole network of
        churches.
