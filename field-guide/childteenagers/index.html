        Appendix 1
      </h4>
      <h1>Children and Teenagers</h1>
      <p>
        It is a daunting discovery when we realize that, as the Church, we are the ones responsible for
        supporting parents in discipling the next generation in our distributed churches as well as providing
        one another with the support, accountability, and grace we need as the spiritual leaders of our
        children.
      </p>
      <p>
        How can a distributed church provide this for families?
      </p>
      <div class='card card--a'>
        <h3>God's Direction</h3>
        <p>
          Jesus said, ‘Let the little children come to Me, and
          do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven
          belongs to such as these.’” &ndash; Matthew 19:14
        </p>
        <p>
          “If anyone causes one of these little ones—those
          who believe in Me—to stumble, it would be better
          for them to have a large millstone hung around
          their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the
          sea.” &ndash; Matthew 18:6
        </p>
        <h3>Our Response</h3>
        <p>
          For children and teens:
          <br>
          Provide a weekly place for the next generation to
          learn stories from the Bible and how to apply them.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='card card--a'>
        <h3>God's Direction</h3>
        <p>
          “Love the LORD your God with all your heart and
          with all your soul and with all your strength. These
          commandments that I give you today are to be on
          your hearts. Impress them on your children. Talk
          about them when you sit at home and when you
          walk along the road, when you lie down and when
          you get up. Tie them as symbols on your hands
          and bind them on your foreheads. Write them on
          the doorframes of your houses and on your gates.”
          &ndash; Deuteronomy 6:5-9
        </p>
        <p>
          “Join together in following my example, brothers
          and sisters, and just as you have us as a model,
          keep your eyes on those who live as we
          do.” &ndash; Philippians 3:17
        </p>
        <p>
          “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and
          with all your soul and with all your strength and
          with all your mind; and, love your neighbor as
          yourself.” &ndash; Luke 10:27
        </p>
        <h3>Our Response</h3>
        <p>
          For parents:
          <br>
          Encourage parents to embrace the new mindset of
          being a disciple and making disciples. Their sons
          and daughters learn how to respond in life by
          watching how their parents respond in
          relationships, in conflict, in success, in failure, in
          disappointment, and in those moments when we
          give in to temptation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Discipling our sons and daughters is not as simple
          as developing godly habits such as praying,
          attending church, or doing acts of service. It is a
          daily walk where we are modeling the attitude of
          Christ and the daily navigation of His greatest
          commandments. (Luke 10:27)
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>
        Getting Started
      </h2>
      <p>
        Your distributed church is unique, so in your quest to provide a weekly place for the next
        generation to learn Bible stories and how to apply them, it may take time to find the best fit. Check
        out the options below, or design your own plan. With prayerful consideration and some trial and
        error, you can develop a plan that fulfills our responsibilities to the next generation and our calling
        as disciples making disciples together.
      </p>
      <div class='card card--a'>
        <h3>Separate Studies for Children and Adults</h3>
        <p>
          In addition to your distributed church gathering, encourage
          parents to take their children and teens weekly to a traditional
          church gathering that offers Sunday School classes (such as
          NACD at Longwood, Mount Dora, or Oviedo) or a local Bible
          Club (such as <a href="//www.awana.org">Awana</a>) to learn Bible
          stories, how to adapt them to their lives, memorize scripture,
          and worship with their peers. At your distributed church
          gathering, include the children and teens in the meal, worship
          time, and prayer. If your distributed church has an adult
          Bible study, that would be a good time for the children to enjoy
          supervised free time, since they have already learned the Bible
          story and life application at the larger gathering.
        </p>
        <h3>Same Study for Everyone</h3>
        <p>
          At your gathering, include the children and teens in the meal,
          worship time, and prayer. As a group, read and discuss The
          Worship, The Word, & The Way take-home devotionals: Daily
          Way and/or Ponder, Pray & Play. Then, to allow adults to have
          more mature conversations, the teens can organize a
          recreational time for the younger children. The take-home
          devotionals (Daily Way/Ponder, Play & Pray) can be downloaded
          from ResourceWell.org/childrenministry.
        </p>
        <h3>Same Study with Breakout Groups</h3>
        <p>
          Lifeway offers three studies, each with separate workbooks
          for children, teens, and adults, so that every age may study the
          selected topic on their own level. The three Bible studies are
          Explore the Bible (book by book), Bible Studies for Life (navigating
          everyday issues), and The Gospel Project (understanding
          the whole story of scripture). This reasonably priced curriculum
          offers a variety of elements including a study plan for every
          age, interactive iOS and Android apps, media components, online
          helps, and Family Connection take-home tools. For more
          information, go to <a href="//www.lifeway.com/go">www.Lifeway.com/go</a>.

      <div class='card card--a'>
        <h3>Separate Studies for Children and Adults</h3>
        <p>
          At your gathering, include the children and teens in the meal,
          worship time, Bible reading, and prayer. During the adult Bible study,
          have one adult teach the children and teens a Bible story using The
          Worship, The Word & The Way curriculum (available at
          ResourceWell.org/ children-ministry).
        </p>
        <p>
          This free downloadable curriculum explores the stories of God from
          Genesis to Revelation in a threeyear cycle. Adaptable elements
          include Bible readings, discussions, crafts, games, puppet sketches, and
          online videos of the sketches as seen in Northland’s Children’s
          Church. We suggest having a few adults alternate as teachers, so
          everyone can regularly take part in the adult fellowship. Northland’s
          global curriculum team is available to train and help you adapt it the
          curriculum to your specific needs. Adaptations for children with
          disabilities are also available.
        </p>
        <h3>Same Study for Everyone</h3>
        <p>
          Download the free Scope & Sequence of The Worship, The
          Word & The Way from ResourceWell.org. Use this guide to
          select Bible stories (appropriate for all ages) for everyone in your
          distributed church to walk through the Bible together from Genesis to
          Revelation. For ideas on discussion topics and life applications, be sure
          to check out the teacher guides and take-home devotionals for each
          Bible story.
        </p>
        <h3>Same Study with Breakout Groups</h3>
        <p>
          American Bible Society publishes 30-day studies for all ages as well as
          for families.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Bible Trek: LUKE, all ages go through the book of Luke together.
          You’ll find daily devotionals for every age as well as a Family Discussion
          Guide at <a href="//www.nowluke.com">www.NowLuke.com</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Acts TRACKS, a study of Acts, is available at NowIsTheTime.AmericanBible.org
        </p>
        <p>
          Both studies are available online as well as in magazine format at
          <a href="//www.bibles.com">www.Bibles.com</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Include everyone in the meal, worship time, Bible reading, and
          prayer. After reading the passage from Acts together, adults,
          teenagers, and children can break out to study the meaning at their own level.
        </p>

      <div class='card card--a'>
        <h3>Separate Studies for Children and Adults</h3>
        <p>
          Include all ages in the meal, worship time, and prayer. While the adults
          participate in their devotional/discussion, an adult or older
          teenager can read and visually illustrate a Bible story using the
          KIDStory storyboard and Bible curriculum. This curriculum includes
          a Bible story discussion using the Socratic teaching approach. It can
          be purchased from <a href="//www.kidsaroundtheworld.com">www.kidsaroundtheworld.com</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Same Study for Everyone</h3>
        <p>
          Adapt the KIDStory Bible curriculum for everyone in your distributed
          church to walk through the Bible together from Genesis to Revelation.
          Worship together and discuss the story’s life applications over a meal.
          Allow time at the end for adults to have further discussion while the
          children and teens enjoy recreational play. This curriculum includes a Bible
          story discussion that uses the Socratic teaching approach. It can
          be purchased at <a href="//www.kidsaroundtheworld.com">www.kidsaroundtheworld.com</a>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='card card--a'>
        <h3>Separate Studies for Children and Adults</h3>
        <p>
          Include all ages in the meal, worship time, and prayer. If the adults are
          participating in The First Principles Series study (<a href="//www.bild.org">www.Bild.org</a>), one
          adult could lead the children in The Apostles’ Creed Study available at
          <a href="//www.ResourceWell.org/childrenministry/other">www.ResourceWell.org/childrenministry/other</a>, or the Young Disciples
          Series, which will also be available at <a href="www.resourceWell.org">www.resourceWell.org</a>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Choosing Curriculum: When selecting curriculum for adults, teens, or children, check to see
        whether the curriculum seems to be more God-centered or man-centered. For example, if the
        overview or table of contents focuses on who God is, what He has done, and how we can serve
        and love Him according to His Word, that will serve your church better than one that focuses on
        the human heroes of the faith and how to be more like them.
      </p>
      <p>
        More about teenagers: Know your teens… the teenage years are not one-size fits all! Take the time
        to ensure that each teenager in your gathering has the opportunity to grow, learn, and to be lead.
        Some teenagers learn best by teaching the younger children. Some need time with peers or time
        alone to discover ways to apply God’s Word to their lives. Be flexible in adapting any of the options
        above.
